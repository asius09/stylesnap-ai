# StyleSnap AI

## üêû Known Bugs

- **Upload image local persist issue:**  
  When a user uploads an image, it is stored in local storage. However, due to browser security restrictions, the file's object URL is not persistent across page reloads. This means that after reloading the page, the uploaded image is lost and cannot be previewed or used again.  
  _Potential solution: Consider using IndexedDB or prompting the user to re-upload after reload._
  - **Prompt suggestion:** If an uploaded image is missing after reload (detected via local storage), show a prompt to the user asking them to re-upload the image. This can be handled in the local storage logic of the app.
